    abstract = "{During the spring of 2009, pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (pH1N1) was recognized and rapidly spread worldwide. To describe the geographic distribution and patient characteristics of pH1N1-associated deaths in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requested information from health departments on all laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 deaths reported from 17 April through 23 July 2009. Data were collected using medical charts, medical examiner reports, and death certificates. A total of 377 pH1N1-associated deaths were identified, for a mortality rate of .12 deaths per 100 000 population. Activity was geographically localized, with the highest mortality rates in Hawaii, New York, and Utah. Seventy-six percent of deaths occurred in persons aged 18–65 years, and 9\\% occurred in persons aged ≥65 years. Underlying medical conditions were reported for 78\\% of deaths: chronic lung disease among adults (39\\%) and neurologic disease among children (54\\%). Overall mortality associated with pH1N1 was low; however, the majority of deaths occurred in persons aged \\&lt;65 years with underlying medical conditions.}",

 abstract = {This article considers the strange history of The World Is Ours (1938), a recently rediscovered promotional short film that touted the virtues of Hollywood during a year of crisis. A joint production of the eight major film companies and Monogram, the short was part of an unsuccessful, million-dollar public relations campaign to win audiences back to the movies. It underscores the film industry's desperation by trying to make the case for the relevance of movies in a changing world.},
